"""Tests for the streaming ref-token rehydrator.

Scope: unit-only. The eval harness pipelines do not currently stream —
``llm.invoke(history)`` is synchronous — so a YAML-driven scenario can't
exercise this code path. The valuable assertions live here: deterministic
chunk-split handling for ref tokens that arrive across SSE/WebSocket
chunk boundaries.
