"""Trilingual evaluation dataset for the PII virtualization framework.

The dataset is a *parallel trilingual* (EN / DE / RU) suite designed for
ACSAC 2026. Each scenario is authored once as a language-agnostic
skeleton in ``scenarios/<bucket>.yaml`` and rendered into three
near-translation ``EvalQuery`` instances sharing a ``scenario_id`` —
only the language and locale-specific PII type vary across the triplet.

Public surface
--------------

  - ``PIIGroundTruth``    — one span of ground-truth PII inside a user turn
  - ``ExpectedToolCall``  — one expected tool invocation
  - ``InjectedPII``       — PII that a tool *result* introduces and that a
                            later turn must reference (cross-turn-taint)
  - ``BoundaryPIIValue``  — raw PII value that could cross the model
                            boundary and must be counted independently of
                            detector success
  - ``EvalQuery``         — one evaluation query, possibly multi-turn
  - ``load_dataset()``    — returns the rendered EvalQuery tuple
  - ``load_fixtures()``   — returns the per-scenario synthetic CRM records
                            that the tools should be primed with before
                            running the experiment

Determinism & reproducibility
-----------------------------

By default ``load_dataset()`` reads the frozen JSONL at
``data/dataset_v1.jsonl``. To re-render from YAML use
``python -m benchmarks.pii_evaluation.dataset.render --freeze``; to
verify reproducibility use ``--check`` to compare against the committed
``data/dataset_v1.sha256``.
